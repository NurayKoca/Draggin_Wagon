"The race car started accelerating and slowing down. With the throttle open, that is, pressing the up arrow button, the engine starts to accelerate at very low speed at low revs. When the car reaches a certain speed, that is, at high revs, it accelerates more and more."
"highAccelClip : Then the engine is at high revs, with the throttle open (i.e. accelerating, but at almost maximum speed)
"lowDecelClip : Engine at low rpm with throttle at minimum (ie engine braking at idle or at very low speed)"
"highDecelClip : Then engine at high revs, throttle at minimum (i.e. engine braking at very high speed)"
"Prevented gimbal lock issues that would cause the car to change direction suddenly. Here are three items used to add more grip than speed controls in case the wheels spin.
        1) emit particles
        2) plays tiure skid sounds
        3) leaves slip marks on the floor
        These effects are controlled via the WheelEffects class
If the car is spinning too much, it reduces the power of the wheel and provides controlled traction."
